"""Log-space cubic-Hermite time quadrature.

The terminal time integral is the binding error term on the differentiable arm,
and the band-limited rule cannot fix it there: exp(lnL_t) is not band-limited
after a nonlinear (phi_ref, psi) marginalization, so FFT reconstruction is the
wrong operation and `_time_marginalize_terminal` refuses it.

This rule claims no band-limitedness.  It interpolates lnL in LOG space, where
the function is smooth and nearly quadratic near its peak, and integrates exp of
that interpolant with per-interval Gauss-Legendre.  So it is valid exactly where
Simpson is valid, and the tests below pin that it is far more accurate in the
regime that actually bites: a peak narrower than the sample spacing.

    Finite differences are exact for a quadratic and not for a cubic, so a cubic
    Hermite segment fed them reproduces quadratics and NOT cubics.  A purely
    quadratic lnL is a Gaussian, which the rule integrates essentially exactly at
    h/sigma = 1; adding a cubic term at the same resolution must degrade it by
    orders of magnitude.

    THE FIXTURE IS THE POINT.  The first version of this test used npts = 513 with
    sigma = deltaT, so t/sigma spanned [-256, 256] and the +0.35 (t/sigma)^3 term
    reached lnL = 5.8e6 at the right edge.  ALL of the reference integral's mass
    then sat in the last few samples -- measured, the final five samples carried
    a fraction 1.000000 of it -- so `e_cubic` measured an exploding boundary layer
    rather than cubic reproduction near the peak.

    That was demonstrated, not assumed.  Re-running the old fixture with the same
    quadrature but CUBIC-EXACT endpoint slopes -- an interpolant that reproduces
    the integrand's cubic exactly, so the assertion should have nothing left to
    detect -- gives e_cubic = 4753 either way, identical to four figures, and the
    assertion passes in both worlds.  It could not tell them apart.  On the
    fixture below the same substitution moves e_cubic from 2.4e-07 to 5.0e-12 and
    the assertion correctly fails, so it is measuring what it claims to.

    Here the span is +-16 sigma and the cubic coefficient is 0.01, so the tail
    mass is ~1e-35 and the integral is genuinely peak-dominated.  That condition
    is asserted below rather than assumed, so the test cannot quietly go vacuous
    again.

    Deliberately NOT a convergence-order test: the error crosses zero near
    h/sigma ~ 3 (see the docstring), so a slope fitted across that region would be
