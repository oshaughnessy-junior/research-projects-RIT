"""Draws of separate dim groups must be independent row by row.

MonteCarloEnsemble._sample() draws each dim group with its own model.sample(n), writes the
draws into the same rows, and reports the product of the group densities as the joint
sampling density.  gmm.sample() used to return rows grouped by component (first ~n*w0 rows
from component 0, ...).  Two groups then shared component labels row by row, so the true
joint density was not the claimed product and E_q[p/q] was far from 1.
